## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an experienced backend engineer with over 8 years of experience in building scalable and robust backend systems. I have been working with various startups for a while now building monoliths/microservices (NodeJs, Scala, Go, et al) and the infra side of things (Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, Terraform and more).

These days I'm exploring distributed systems, concurrency and so on and I mostly write in Go.
